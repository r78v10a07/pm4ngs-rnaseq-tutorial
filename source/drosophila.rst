RNA-seq of the lobe-less (lol) mutants in Drosophila melanogaster
=================================================================

BioProject: PRJDB5673_

Lobe-less (lol) encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) required for the development of Drosophila mushroom body,
a center of insect memories and learning. RNA-seq was carried out in the control (w[1118]) and lol mutant flies
to identify genes regulated by lol lncRNA.
