RNA-seq of the lobe-less (lol) mutants in Drosophila melanogaster
=================================================================

Lobe-less (lol) encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) required for the development of Drosophila mushroom body,
a center of insect memories and learning. RNA-seq was carried out in the control (w[1118]) and lol mutant flies
to identify genes regulated by lol lncRNA.

From the manuscript: `Genetic interactions between Protein Kinase D and Lobe mutants during eye development of
Drosophila melanogaster <https://hereditasjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41065-019-0113-9>`_

BioProject
----------

A BioProject is a collection of biological data related to a single initiative, originating from a single organization
or from a consortium. A BioProject record provides users a single place to find links to the diverse data types
generated for that project.

SRA
---

Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data, available through multiple cloud providers and NCBI servers, is the largest
publicly available repository of high throughput sequencing data.
